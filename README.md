# HR-Analytics
## Tools: Python, Microsoft Power BI

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to use the EDA process. The data required to be cleaned from the HR analytical dataset, needed to be visualized based on several features and established relationships.

35 features and 1470 samples were found in the dataset. No missing values or duplicate cells were found.

## Key Insights

1. 1470 employees' information was given, where the number of active employees was 1233 and employee attrition was 237. The attrition rate was 16.12%.

2. The age range of the employees was between 18 to 60. Three individual departments were found. Four slicer sections were used based on age, department, gender, and marital status.

3. Based on attrition, education fields were categorized, with life sciences listed at the top and human resources listed last.

4. From the attrition information, a maximum number of females were sales executives and males were laboratory technicians.

5. From the attrition rate by business travel, 16.71% never traveled, whereas 24.91% traveled frequently.

## Recommendations:

1. Employee retention initiatives should be implemented, and departments with high attrition rates should be examined.

2. Since the attrition rate for men is higher than that of women, workplace equality should be taken into account.

3. Offer sufficient guidance and assistance for positions with a high turnover rate.
